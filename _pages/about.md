I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the London School of Economics, specializing in political economy, industrial organisation, and the economics of media. I am on the job market in 2025/2026. My research combines large-scale media engagement data with tools from causal inference, structural modeling, and natural language processing to study equilibria in the market for news and better understand the supply and demand drivers of news consumption and learning outcomes. My most recent work studies how social networks and algorithmic curation shape political polarization and the spread of misinformation. My job market paper, 'Quantifying Echo Chambers and Their Impact on News Engagement: Evidence from a Facebook Algorithm Update', develops a new method to measure network homophily and shows how algorithmic changes amplify tribalism and misinformation online. Beyond academia, I have professional experience as a Data Scientist at Quantco, where I worked on algorithmic pricing models, and as an Economist at Amazon, where I applied causal inference and machine learning to e-commerce problems. I also have 3 years of work experience prior to my PhD in digital marketing and management consultancy.
